# In Silico Antibacterial Study

## Overview
This repository documents my undergraduate in silico research project focused on identifying potential antibacterial compounds against *Vibrio parahaemolyticus*.

**Note:** The undergraduate thesis abstract is available in the `results/thesis_abstract.md` file.

## Methods
- PASS Online for biological activity prediction
- Molecular docking using blind docking approach
- Target proteins: PirA, PirB, TDH
- Docking evaluation based on binding affinity (ΔG), inhibition constant (Ki), and protein–ligand interactions

## Tools
- AutoDock / AutoDock Vina
- PASS Online
- ChemDraw
- Avogadro
- Protox Online
- PkCSM
- PubChem
- PDB
- BIOVIA Discovery Studio

## Status
This repository is currently being developed as part of my bioinformatics learning portfolio.
