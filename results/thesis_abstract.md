# Undergraduate Thesis Abstract

The Indonesian fisheries sector has great potential for the 
national economy, but faces quality challenges due to bacterial 
contamination caused by the presence of Vibrio 
parahaemolyticus virulence factors such as toxin proteins and 
hemolysin proteins that can cause disease in shrimp and humans, 
thus requiring alternative solutions such as the use of guava 
leaves (Syzygium malaccense (L.) Merr. & Perry) with anti-
Vibrio activity that can be developed through molecular docking 
technology. The objective of this study is to assess potential 
toxicity of jambu bol leaves and analyze the interaction of active 
compounds in jambu bol with virulence factors of V. 
parahaemolyticus. This study was conducted in silico by docking 
molecules between ligands derived from the phytochemical 
compounds of jambu bol leaves with the receptors Pir A (3X0T), 
Pir B (3X0U), and Thermostable Direct Hemolysin (3A57), 
along with antibacterial potential analysis, toxicity testing, and 
identification of docking results. Based on 103 compounds from 
guava leaves, 14 compounds were selected with antibacterial 
activity (Pa > 0.5) which are classified as safe for use in humans 
or animals (toxicity class 5) and are not hepatotoxic or 
mutagenic. Docking results showed that gentamicin, as the 
positive control, had the highest affinity for the test compounds 
PirA and PirB, while quercitrin, guaijaverin, and Myricetin-O-
Glucoside exhibited the best affinity for TDH, surpassing the 
chlorogenic acid and gentamicin as control. Overall, these three 
phytochemical compounds have potential as TDH inhibitor 
candidates, although the activity of the compounds against PirA 
and PirB remains below that of gentamicin.
